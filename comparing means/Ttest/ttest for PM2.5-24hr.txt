Ho: mu=0 
where mu is the true population mean of differences in 2019 and 2020(2019-2020) for all cities simmilar to those in the sample that measured:
PM2.5-24hr for:
2019-2020
Ha: mu>0 
where mu is the true population mean of differences in 2019 and 2020(2019-2020) for all cities simmilar to those in the sample that measured:
PM2.5-24hr for:
2019-2020
n=858
a sample of size 85 was taken and 85>30
The population size is at least 858 and at least 10 times larger than 85
The sample was randomly selected with random.choices
All conditions for inference have been met
The t statistic is:
1.633954895748905
The p value is:
0.05300549570977063
Because the p  value is 0.05300549570977063 and greater than the significance level 0.05 we fail to reject the null hypothesis.
There is not convincing evidence that the means for all cities simmilar to those in the sample that measured PM2.5-24hr are lower in 2020 than in 2019
