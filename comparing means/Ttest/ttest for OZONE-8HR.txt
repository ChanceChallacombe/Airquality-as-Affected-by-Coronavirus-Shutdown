Ho: mu=0 
where mu is the true population mean of differences in 2019 and 2020(2019-2020) for all cities simmilar to those in the sample that measured:
OZONE-8HR for:
2019-2020
Ha: mu>0 
where mu is the true population mean of differences in 2019 and 2020(2019-2020) for all cities simmilar to those in the sample that measured:
OZONE-8HR for:
2019-2020
n=1071
a sample of size 107 was taken and 107>30
The population size is at least 1071 and at least 10 times larger than 107
The sample was randomly selected with random.choices
All conditions for inference have been met
The t statistic is:
11.50835606725858
The p value is:
1.126286616388079e-20
Because the p  value is 1.126286616388079e-20 and lower than the significance level 0.05 we reject the null hypothesis.
There is convincing evidence that the means for all cities simmilar to those in the sample that measured OZONE-8HR are lower in 2020 than in 2019
