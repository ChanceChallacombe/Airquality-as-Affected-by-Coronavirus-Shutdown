Ho: mu=0 
where mu is the true population mean of differences in 2019 and 2020(2019-2020) for all cities simmilar to those in the sample that measured:
PM2.5-24hr for:
2019-2020
Ha: mu>0 
where mu is the true population mean of differences in 2019 and 2020(2019-2020) for all cities simmilar to those in the sample that measured:
PM2.5-24hr for:
2019-2020
n=858
a sample of 858 was taken and 858>30
The population size is at least 858 and at least 10 times larger than n
The sample was randomly selected with random.choices
All conditions for inference have been metThe t statistic is:
2.2260819336028654
The p value is:
0.014343153125817696
Because the p  value is 0.014343153125817696 and lower than the significance level 0.05 we reject the null hypothesis.
There is convincing evidence that the means for all cities simmilar to those in the sample that measured PM2.5-24hr are lower in 2020 than in 2019
