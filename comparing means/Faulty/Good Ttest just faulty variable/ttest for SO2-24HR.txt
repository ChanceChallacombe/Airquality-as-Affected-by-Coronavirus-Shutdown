Ho: mu=0 
where mu is the true population mean of differences in 2019 and 2020(2019-2020) for all cities simmilar to those in the sample that measured:
SO2-24HR for:
2019-2020
Ha: mu>0 
where mu is the true population mean of differences in 2019 and 2020(2019-2020) for all cities simmilar to those in the sample that measured:
SO2-24HR for:
2019-2020
n=1041
a sample of 1041 was taken and 1041>30
The population size is at least 1041 and at least 10 times larger than n
The sample was randomly selected with random.choices
All conditions for inference have been metThe t statistic is:
2.3648997080898564
The p value is:
0.00986237648133033
Because the p  value is 0.00986237648133033 and lower than the significance level 0.05 we reject the null hypothesis.
There is convincing evidence that the means for all cities simmilar to those in the sample that measured SO2-24HR are lower in 2020 than in 2019
