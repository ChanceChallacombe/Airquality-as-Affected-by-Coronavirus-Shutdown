Ho: mu=0 
where mu is the true population mean of differences in 2019 and 2020(2019-2020) for all cities simmilar to those in the sample that measured:
CO-8hr for:
2019-2020
Ha: mu>0 
where mu is the true population mean of differences in 2019 and 2020(2019-2020) for all cities simmilar to those in the sample that measured:
CO-8hr for:
2019-2020
n=460
a sample of 460 was taken
the population size is at least 460 and at least 10 times larger than n
The sample was randomly selected and is independent because of replacement
The t statistic is:
4.391041580161112
The p value is:
3.382918258521111e-05
Because the p  value is 3.382918258521111e-05 and lower than the significance level 0.05 we reject the null hypothesis.
There is convincing evidence that the means for all cities simmilar to those in the sample that measured CO-8hr are lower in 2020 than in 2019
