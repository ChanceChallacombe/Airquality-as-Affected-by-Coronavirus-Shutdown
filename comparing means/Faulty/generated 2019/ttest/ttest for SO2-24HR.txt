Ho: mu=0 
where mu is the true population mean of differences in 2019 and 2020(2019-2020) for all cities simmilar to those in the sample that measured:
SO2-24HR for:
2019-2020
Ha: mu>0 
where mu is the true population mean of differences in 2019 and 2020(2019-2020) for all cities simmilar to those in the sample that measured:
SO2-24HR for:
2019-2020
n=1151
a sample of 1151 was taken
the population size is at least 1151 and at least 10 times larger than n
The sample was randomly selected and is independent because of replacement
The t statistic is:
6.266576579243366
The p value is:
3.384187748676905e-09
Because the p  value is 3.384187748676905e-09 and lower than the significance level 0.05 we reject the null hypothesis.
There is convincing evidence that the means for all cities simmilar to those in the sample that measured SO2-24HR are lower in 2020 than in 2019
