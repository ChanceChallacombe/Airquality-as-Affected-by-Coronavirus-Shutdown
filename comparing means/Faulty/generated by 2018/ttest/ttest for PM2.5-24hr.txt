Ho: mu=0 
where mu is the true population mean of differences in 2019 and 2020(2019-2020) for all cities simmilar to those in the sample that measured:
PM2.5-24hr for:
2019-2020
Ha: mu>0 
where mu is the true population mean of differences in 2019 and 2020(2019-2020) for all cities simmilar to those in the sample that measured:
PM2.5-24hr for:
2019-2020
n=30
a sample of 30 was taken
the population size is at least 904 and at least 10 times larger than n
The sample was randomly selected and is independent because of replacement
The t statistic is:
1.0514969808722825
The p value is:
0.1508569122633566
Because the p  value is 0.1508569122633566 and greater than the significance level 0.05 we fail to reject the null hypothesis.
There is not convincing evidence that the means for all cities simmilar to those in the sample that measured PM2.5-24hr are lower in 2020 than in 2019
